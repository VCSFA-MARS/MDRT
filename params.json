  "body": "### Welcome to MARS Data Review Tool Project.\r\nThis project was started in 2013 to process and review MARS ECS data. The current version parses FCS .delim files and allows plotting up to three time-synchronized subplots at a time. Additional helper functions for quantifying trends, checking boundary violations and many other tasks are included.\r\n\r\n### Usage and Requirements\r\nThe MARS Data Review Tool is designed to be used in MATLAB and does not require special MATLAB toolboxes. Future development efforts will focus on creating a deployable application for individual engineers, leveraging the MATLAB deployment kit.\r\n\r\nMinimum Requirements:\r\n* Matlab R2014b (or greater)\r\n* Mac OSX 10.6+ or Linux (to run Matlab)\r\n* MS Windows 7 + (known issues with .delim parsing)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is administered by Nicholas Counts (@nickcounts). \r\n* Project Manager: Nicholas Counts (@nickcounts).\r\n* Project Manager: Walter Taraila\r\n* UI Developer: Paige Pruce\r\n* Backend Developer: Staten Longo\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
